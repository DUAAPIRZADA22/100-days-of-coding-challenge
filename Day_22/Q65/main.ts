// Determine the Remainder:

// from dividing them using the % sign. For example, remainder(5, 2) should give 1.
//this function finds the leftover of dividing two numbers
function remainder(num1: number, num2: number): number {
    return num1 % num2
}                                                          //gives back the leftover of num1 divided by num2

//trying it with 5 divided by 2
console.log(remainder(5, 2));      //output is 1
//this tells us the leftover, which is 1 here.
